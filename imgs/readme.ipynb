    "In this project you will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower that the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. \n",

    "This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.\n",

    "1. mkdir build\n",

    "3. cmake ..\n",
    "4. make\n",

    "\n",
    "* cmake >= 3.5\n",
    "  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)\n",
    "* make >= 4.1\n",
    "  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros\n",
    "  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)\n",
    "  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)\n",
    "* gcc/g++ >= 5.4\n",
    "  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros\n",
    "  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)\n",
    "  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)\n",

    "## Basic Build Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone this repo.\n",
    "2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`\n",
    "3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` \n",
    "   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G \"Unix Makefiles\" && make`\n",

    "## Editor Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to\n",

    "using the following settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* indent using spaces\n",
    "* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)\n",
